Vehicles are one of the biggest air polluters. They release carbon dioxide as well as other greenhouse gases. Greenhouse gases are known for trapping heat in the atmosphere, slowly causing the temperature of the Earth to rise. The warming of the Earth is problematic as it leads to many imbalances such as the melting of glaciers and the rise of sea level. Furthermore, car pollutants affect humans in different ways: it might cause increased respiratory problems or irritation for the skin and eyes.

I raised concerns about the chemical Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, also known as DDT, and how it is toxic to the environment. Experimental research on DDT is known to cause effects on the liver, kidney and nervous system of mice, rats and dogs. When released in the ecosystems, it is widely toxic to many animals, especially marine animals as DDT is insoluble in water. Additionally, it also leads to eggshells thinning consequently declining the population of certain bird species. For humans, it is a carcinogen and can accumulate in the body from consuming animals with high levels of DDT.

Climate change is very important and will affect all of us. Our house is on fire and we have the right to demand a safe future. That is why if we work together to adopt changes, such as reducing our meat consumption, we will help reduce the carbon footprint of humans on Earth. Raising livestock, more specifically red meat, is one of the biggest greenhouse gas emitters. It requires a lot of freshwater and resources to feed and raise the cattle, these resources could be used to feed more people instead. Furthermore, the cattle need a place to graze, hence land being cleared for that purpose resulting in the erosion of the soil. Other times, more dramatic land clearing happens such as deforestation. Consequently, this leads to the loss of habitats for many animals and less trees are present to absorb CO2. A meat based diet produces more emissions per unit than a plant based diet. To help the Earth and reduce the carbon footprint, it is possible to reduce emissions by choosing plant based alternatives and reducing the consumption of red meat."}),Object(h.jsx)(l.a,{className:"greta-btn",variant:"primary",size:"lg",active:!0,onClick:function(){return e.push("/story")},children:"Return"})]})}var I=t.p+"static/media/berta.4d32961f.jpg",k=t.p+"static/media/wangarimaathai.526eb0ae.jpg";function N(){var e=Object(c.f)();return Object(h.jsxs)("div",{className:"container-fluid deforestation-bgimage",children:[Object(h.jsx)("img",{className:"berta-img",src:I,alt:"Berta Caceres Image"}),Object(h.jsx)("img",{className:"wangari-img",src:k,alt:"Wangari Maathai Image"}),Object(h.jsx)(g.a,{className:"wangari-text",speed:5,children:Object(h.jsx)("span",{children:"Hello!

I was motivated to start this movement, when I noticed how much plastic and rubbish was prevalent in the streets of my community and how much it was affecting agriculture, animals, and the people. I love to empower women and to help reduce the plastic crisis waste around me by finding creative ways to upcycle it. I am glad that my initiative has helped the women in my community earn a source of income that can be used for their education or to support their family. Single use plastic is one of the leading items in landfill and in the ocean. They are very harmful for the environment as well as animals. For instance, in oceans sea turtles will see plastic bags and confuse them with jellyfish. Plastic takes a long time to degrade itself and uses fossil fuels to be made. An easy way to slowly reduce the use of single use plastic is to trade single use plastic with items that prioritize reusability and sustainability. Some examples include: replacing a single use plastic water bottle with a metal one, bringing a reusable bag when grocery shopping or buying in bulk to avoid packaging."})}),Object(h.jsx)(l.a,{className:"isatou-btn",variant:"primary",size:"lg",active:!0,onClick:function(){return e.push("/story")},children:"Return"})]})}function T(){var e=Object(c.f)();return Object(h.jsx)("div",{className:"container-fluid thanks-bgimage",children:Object(h.jsx)(l.a,{className:"thanks-btn",variant:"primary",size:"lg",active:!0,onClick:function(){return e.push("/")},children:"Return to Home"})})}var D=function(){return Object(h.jsx)(o.a,{children:Object(h.jsxs)(c.c,{children:[Object(h.jsx)(c.a,{exact:!0,path:"/",children:Object(h.jsx)(m,{})}),Object(h.jsx)(c.a,{path:"/intro",children:Object(h.jsx)(f,{})}),Object(h.jsx)(c.a,{path:"/story",children:Object(h.jsx)(b,{})}),Object(h.jsx)(c.a,{path:"/gladys",children:Object(h.jsx)(y,{})}),Object(h.jsx)(c.a,{path:"/rachel",children:Object(h.jsx)(w,{})}),Object(h.jsx)(c.a,{path:"/greta",children:Object(h.jsx)(O,{})}),Object(h.jsx)(c.a,{path:"/bertawangari",children:Object(h.jsx)(N,{})}),Object(h.jsx)(c.a,{path:"/isatou",children:Object(h.jsx)(z,{})}),Object(h.jsx)(c.a,{path:"/thanks",children:Object(h.jsx)(T,{})})]})})},S=function(e){e&&e instanceof Function&&t.e(3).then(t.bind(null,73)).then((function(a){var t=a.getCLS,n=a.getFID,i=a.getFCP,s=a.getLCP,r=a.getTTFB;t(e),n(e),i(e),s(e),r(e)}))};r.a.render(Object(h.jsx)(i.a.StrictMode,{children:Object(h.jsx)(D,{})}),document.getElementById("root")),S()}},[[72,1,2]]]);
